# Image Processor

_Smita Rosemary and Ben Bishop â€“ CS3500 Fall 2022, Northeastern University_

## Overview

This project represents an Image Processor that allows you to manipulate and enhance a given image.

The Image Processor allows a user to load an Image into the program, save it, and apply
transformations such as:

* Visualizing the red, blue, green, alpha, luma, or intensity channels of each pixel in an image as
  a greyscale image
* Vertically or horizontally flipping an image
* Brightening or darkening an image
* Blurring or sharpening an image
* Filtering an image to greyscale or sepia

The user interacts with the Image Processor through the command line interface (CLI). or they can
also specify a script file to run as a command line argument, which will run the script and exit the
program. More details on interacting with the program can be found in the [USEME.md](USEME.md) file.

The program currently supports "PPM" images and any image type supported by the Java ImageIO
library. We guarantee support for "PNG", "JPG/JPEG", and "BMP" images. The program will
automatically detect the format to save to/load from based on the file extension.

We have provided two test images located in the `res` folder named `ExampleImage.ppm`
and `ExampleImage2.png`. We have also processed this image with all available commands to visualize
transformations without running the program and saved them to the subfolder `res/processed`
. `ExampleImage.ppm` was created by Smita Rosemary, and has been used with her
permission. `ExampleImage2.png` was created by Ben Bishop, and has been used with his permission.

## How to Use

Instructions on how to use the program can be found in the [USEME.md](USEME.md) file.

## Changelog

### Assignment 6 (11/22/2022)

_Third version. Retained all existing functionality, and added a new view, allowing the user to view
the program graphically rather than through text.

#### Changes

* Added `ImageUtils` class in order to add the support of making a histogram based on the pixels of
  the current image. The histogram includes data that correspond to the R, G, B , and intensity
  values of a pixel.
* Added support for a GUI, through the interface `ImageProcessorGui` to allow the user to view the
  program in a graphical interface instead of a text based one.
    * Added an implementation of the aforementioned interface: `ImageProcessorGuiImpl` : Implements
      the ImageProcessorGui interface and it's methods. Renders the view graphically and changes it
      according to the user's interactions.
* Added support for the GUI's controller, through the interface `ImageProcessorGuiController` to
  make features of the program that the user can apply.
    * Added an implementation of the aforementioned interface: `ImageProcessorGuiControllerImpl` :
      Controls what the viewer views, by adding methods that carry out the action listeners.
* Added `ImageUtils` class in order to add the support of making a histogram based on the pixels of
  the current image. The histogram includes data that correspond to the R, G, B , and intensity
  values of a pixel.
* Added support for `Panels`: to represent the different panels that will be available to the user.
    * Added classes that extend the JMenuBar abstract class, `HistogramPanel`, `MenubarPanel`
      , `MessagePanel`, `PreviewPanel`, and `TransformationPanel`.

### Assignment 5 (11/10/2022)

_Second version. Retained all existing functionality, and added support for new transformations and
the ability to run from a script file._

#### Changes

* Added support for blurring, sharpening, and applying a sepia or greyscale filter to an image.
    * Added more implementations of the `ImageTransformation` interface in the model (`Blur`
      , `Sharpen`, `Sepia`, and `Greyscale`) to apply these filters to `Image`s.
    * Added a new implementation of the `ImageProcessorCmd` interface in the controller
      (`FilterCmd`) to handle the execution of the `blur`, `sharpen`, `sepia`, and `greyscale`
      commands.
    * Modified the `addCommands` method in the `ImageProcessorControllerImpl` class to add the four
      new commands to the map of supported commands.
    * Updated the `renderMenu` method in the `ImageProcessorViewImpl` to include the new filters in
      the menu.
    * Added new test methods in both the `ImageControllerTest` and `ImageTransformationTest` classes
      to test the new commands.
    * Added new example images in the `res/processed` folder to demonstrate the new filters.
* Added a new higher-resolution example image in the `res` folder (`ExampleImage2.png`) to make
  visualization of the new filters easier.
* Added support for loading and saving images from more conventional file formats
    * Added a new implementation of the `ImageFileHandler` interface in the
      controller (`ImageIOHandler`) to handle loading and saving images using the Java ImageIO
      library. This library supports a wide variety of image formats, including "png", "jpg", "jpeg"
      , and "bmp". These four formats are guaranteed to be supported by the program, but others may
      be as well.
    * Modified the `LoadCmd` and `SaveCmd` classes to check the file format of the image to be
      loaded/saved and use the `ImageIOHandler` if it is not a "ppm" image.
    * Added new test methods in the `ImageControllerTest` class to test loading/saving images using
      the new file formats.
* Added support for loading and running a script file as a command line option.
    * Modified the `ImageProcessorRunner` class to check for the presence of
      the `-script <script text file>` command line option, and fallback to the standard CLI if it
      is not present.
* Updated the test methods in the `ImageProcessorViewImplTest` class to ensure the new menu is
  displayed.
* Added support for running the program from a JAR file (see [USEME.md](USEME.md) for details).
    * Added a new `MANIFEST.MF` file to the `META-INF` folder to specify the main class of the
      program.
    * Built the program into a JAR file located at `res/ImageProcessor.jar`.
* Updated the `README.md` file to include more information about the image processor and the new
  features implemented in this version.
* Created a new `USEME.md` file to document how to use the program.

#### Bug Fixes

* `ImagePPMHandler`
    * Fixed that the `process` method would throw an exception if the file was empty.
    * Fixed that the `process` method did not close scanners it opened.
* `Visualize`
    * Replaced typecasting with rounding in the `transform` method to result in more accurate
      transformations.
* Cleaned up JavaDoc comments to be more consistent and accurate.
* Cleaned up error messages to be more consistent and accurate.

* Use the image processor within the terminal
* Load an image into the program
* Save an image from the program
* Brighten or darken an image
